# 5 - Machine Learning

## Problem Statement

Using the dataset from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Car+Evaluation, create a machine learning model to predict the buying price given the following parameters:

Maintenance = High <br>
Number of doors = 4 <br>
Lug Boot Size = Big <br>
Safety = High <br>
Class Value = Good <br>

## Solution

The work for this section can be viewed either via the `EDA and Machine Learning on Cars dataset.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook, or the exported notebook (to html) can be viewed here:
